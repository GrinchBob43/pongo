# video games v. movies

The motion we perceive when watching a movie or playing a video game isn't real.
It's an illusion created by showing us a series of still images in rapid
succession. In a movie, these images are shown at a constant rate, usually 24
frames per second (fps). The frame rate in a video game is often higher and
variable, especially if other applications are consuming computer resources.

But unlike a movie, the images in a video game aren't predetermined. Shout at
the screen all you want, it won't change the movie. When playing a video game,
**you control (some part of) the action**. And that means all those still images
-- 30 or 60 or even more per second -- have to be created "on the fly".
