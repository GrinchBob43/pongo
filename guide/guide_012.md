# create `pong.py`

For now, we'll keep all our code in a single file. Let's create that file now.

You can either add a new file called `pong.py` using the file explorer in your
Codespace. Or, if you're feeling adventurous, you can create it from the
command line:

```bash
touch pong.py
```

However you do it, let's take this opportunity to practice the `git` commands
we just learned:

- "stage" the new file with `git add pong.py`
- see what `git status` outputs now that you're adding a file
- "commit" the new file with `git commit -m "init"`
- "push" the commit to GitHub with `git push`
- navigate to your GitHub repo to confirm the commit was added
