# vanishing window

Now that you're connected to a virtual desktop, let's try running our
window-creating code. If you can, have your virtual desktop open in one window
and your Codespace open in another such that you can see both at the same time.

At the terminal in your Codespace, type the command:

```bash
python pong.py
```

Now hit enter and watch the virtual desktop. Did you see anything?

What you _should_ see is the title bar of your game window appear and then
disappear very quickly. The good news: our code is working! The bad news: we
haven't (yet) figured out how to keep the window open.
