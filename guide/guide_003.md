# problems to solve

Because video games are interactive, we need to be able to:

1. process player input
2. keep track of game state
3. draw the game to the screen "on the fly"

For the Pong game we're building, we'll need to:

- detect key presses to determine how to move each paddle
- keep track of game state:
  - the position of the paddles
  - the position, speed, and direction of the ball
  - the score
  - a few other things, like color codes and screen dimensions
- calculate the new game state based on game rules and player input
- draw the ball, paddles, and screen to the screen
