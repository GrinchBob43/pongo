# `pygame` and a (very) basic game loop

- [x] get a basic understanding of what goes into making a video game
- [x] gather and practice our tools: `pygame`, GitHub, Codespace (with virtual
      desktop!), and `git`
- [x] get our development environment set up

Check, check, check. We're ready to start coding. We'll start by poking around
`pygame` a bit. By the end of this section, we'll have constructed a very basic
game loop. That'll be the skeleton of our game.
