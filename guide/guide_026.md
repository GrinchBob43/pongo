# `pygame`'s coordinate system

You're familiar with the Cartesian coordinate system from math class. Theorigin
-- the point (0, 0) -- is in the middle. In both the x and y directions, you can
have negative values.

`pygame` also has a coordinate system, but its origin point is in the top-left
corner. The x-axis increases as you move right, and the y-axis increases as you
move down. This sort of coordinate system is pretty common in computer graphics.
