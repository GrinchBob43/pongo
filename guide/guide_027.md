# pixels

When we created our game window, we set its width to 800 pixels and its height
to 600 pixels. From these dimensions, its simple to calculate the number of
pixels in the window: 800 \* 600 = 480,000. That's a lot of pixels! We can think
of the window as a grid of pixels, with 800 columns and 600 rows. The top-left
corner of the window is pixel (0, 0), and the bottom-right corner is pixel (799,
599).
