# importing `pygame`

Before we can use any `pygame` functionality, we need to `import` it.

At the top of `pong.py`, add:

```python
import pygame
```

And then, in the terminal, run `pong.py`:

```bash
python pong.py
```

If you did everything correctly, you'll see a message printed to the terminal:

```
pygame 2.5.2 (SDL 2.28.2, Python 3.11.4)
Hello from the pygame community. https://www.pygame.org/contribute.html
```

Where did that come from? We didn't add any `print` commands. So it must have
come from `pygame`, right?

Based on what you're seeing, what can you infer about what Python does when
it imports a module?
