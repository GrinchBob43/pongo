# summary: basic game loop

You did it! You wrote a basic game loop. It's pretty empty. We'll fill it soon.
We took our time getting here, but we learned a lot along the way:

1. how to create a window with `pygame`
2. how to use a loop to keep our program running so the window will stay open
3. how to control the speed of the game loop
4. how to poll for events
5. how to test for a specific event type and act on it
6. how to use a flag variable to control the game loop

Next up: drawing to the window.
